/**
 * This plugin adds methods to configure a module with Beam's defaults, called "natures".
 *
 * <p>The natures available:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Java   - Configures plugins commonly found in Java projects
 *   <li>Go     - Configures plugins commonly found in Go projects
 *   <li>Docker - Configures plugins commonly used to build Docker containers
 *   <li>Grpc   - Configures plugins commonly used to generate source from protos
 *   <li>Avro   - Configures plugins commonly used to generate source from Avro specifications
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>For example, see applyJavaNature.
